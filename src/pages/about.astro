	<p>ATXPIXEL is a programmable lighting studio specializing in custom LED system architecture.</p>
	<p>We approach light as a structured system, not a decorative afterthought.</p>
	<p>Our process integrates:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Engineering</li>
		<li>Control logic</li>
		<li>Power management</li>
		<li>Material fabrication</li>
		<li>Environmental planning</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Every installation is designed from first principles, tailored to the space, the constraints,
		and the desired experience.
	</p>
	<p>We do not deploy templates. We design infrastructure.</p>
	<p>Built in Austin. Engineered for precision. Designed to evolve.</p>
