	<p>ATXPIXEL designs and deploys custom programmable LED systems.</p>
	<p>
		Influenced by Austin&apos;s culture of technical excellence and creative autonomy, we engineer
		lighting environments built for performance, control, and longevity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Light is treated as a structured system - powered correctly, controlled precisely, and
		integrated cleanly - regardless of whether the outcome is architectural, ambient, or
		decorative, our goal for excellence shines.
	</p>
	<p>Our process integrates:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Electrical planning and load management</li>
		<li>Controller strategy and signal integrity</li>
		<li>Structured power distribution</li>
		<li>Precision fabrication and concealment</li>
		<li>Environmental and thermal planning</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Every installation is developed from first principles - tailored to the space, the constraints,
		and the intended experience.
	</p>
	<p>We do not deploy templates.<br />We design structured lighting systems.</p>
	<p>Engineered for precision.<br />Built to perform.<br />Designed to evolve.</p>
