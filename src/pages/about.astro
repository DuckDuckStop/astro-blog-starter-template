	<p>ATXPIXEL designs and installs custom programmable LED lighting systems.</p>
	<p>
		Based in Austin, we build lighting that works reliably, performs well, and lasts.
	</p>
	<p>
		We treat lighting as a system - powered correctly, easy to control, and cleanly installed -
		whether it&apos;s architectural, ambient, or purely decorative. Our goal is simple: do it right.
	</p>
	<p>Our process integrates:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Planning electrical loads and power needs</li>
		<li>Choosing and configuring the right controllers</li>
		<li>Designing clean, organized power distribution</li>
		<li>Fabricating and hiding components neatly</li>
		<li>Managing heat and environmental factors</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We design structured lighting systems that are:</p>
	<p>Precise.<br />Reliable.<br />Built to adapt over time.</p>
